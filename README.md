Disclaimer: Hey Trevor - my partner for this dropped out so I did my best to try and complete it on my own. I completed the Design portion of the project as best I could and followed along with your in class build to at least try to understand what you built - I then attempted to put my designs into action with your class build but there came to a point that I had to accept my limitations and just hand in this hot mess of code and hope for the best!
